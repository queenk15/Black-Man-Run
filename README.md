# Black Man Run
This game is the game of the new ager. This game is perfect if you like gaming. To run and play my game all you need is Python 3.4.3 and the corrisponding pygame.


## How to play the game

Using the arrow keys race through my game.

- up arrow: jump
- left /right arrow: moving forward and backward
- down arrow: nothing


### Coming Soon

In my next version of this game I will adding:

1. A double jump
2. New worlds
3. Making Enemies die
4. Making it more user friendly
